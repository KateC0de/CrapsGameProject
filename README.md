# CrapsGameProject
This is a Craps game project written in Java. This project was a part of my college course. The program works this way:
    Description of the rules of the game is outputted to the user/player.
    Computer rolls the dice for you. Press enter to see the result.
    Result is dispalyed on the screen.
    After you win/lose, you are asked if you would like to play again.
